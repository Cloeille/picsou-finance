"""What differs between the BPCE banks served by this package: one frozen `Site`.

Caisse d'Epargne and Banque Populaire run the same login platform (icgauth,
virtual keypad, Sécur'Pass), the same OAuth2 PKCE + SAML chain and the same
data API, on their own hosts. Every module of this package reads the hosts, the
optional second OAuth apps and the region picker from the `Site` it is handed at
call time; nothing bank-specific is decided at import time.
