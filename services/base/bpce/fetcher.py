"""Reads the accounts and their transactions from a BPCE bank's data host.

Read-only: GET calls only, with the Bearer token minted by `replay`. The raw
JSON goes to `accounts_parser.build_import`, whose result is serialised to the
`POST /accounts` contract (money as decimal strings, never floats).

Fatal, all-or-nothing: the synthesis call and the current account (a transport error,
a parse error, a malformed page or an exceeded page cap on it raises `UpstreamUnavailable`
or `UpstreamFormatChanged`). Any other account that cannot
be read or serialised is left out of `accounts` and listed in `unavailable`
(`{externalId, kind, code}`, synthesis order). `replay.SessionExpired` always
propagates (main.py replays once), as do `InvalidSessionState` and `HostNotAllowed`
raised outside the loan token and the PER detail. Nothing read from the bank (balance, label, IBAN) or
the token is logged or put in an error message: errors carry a stable code and a
fixed text.

Observed on the real bank (spike/E2E_FINDINGS.md): the synthesis call, the
transactions query, and the `meta.nextPageToken` / `pageToken` pagination
(the last page has no token). Not verified: see `_fetch_card_pages`.
